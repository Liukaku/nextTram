# Site for checking the next tram times

Try it on mobile too!

This is a front end built using:

- NextJS
- TypeScript
- Framer-Motion
- TailwindCSS

This connects to a NodeJS Express API server which handles requests made to the Metrolink API

The back end is written in 2 languages for experimentation.

The back end was written in Java and deployed in AWS Lambda through the API Gateway

This is kept up to date automatically through a Golang lambda, S3 and AWS Event Scheduler
